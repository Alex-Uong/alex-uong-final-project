#### Description:

I didn't know that we have to submit the final project before 2025 so I have to use a project that I did with my friend to submit. It was also my effort on computer science so I hope it will work.

This project is a phone selling website that display phones and users can choose which phones to buy.

I used html, tailwind, css, javaScript... to do this project.

What you can see on customer page:

- I use api to render the product list.
- Users can filter brands of phones (Apple and Samsung)
- Users can add phones to cart by click on "add to cart". They can add more by clicking more times.
- Users can click on cart button to open the basket (cart) so see what's inside.
- They can increase or decrease the quantity of the product by clicking on plus or minus button.
- When the quantity is 1, and user click on minus button again, there will be a prompt to check if the user wants to deleted the product out of the cart.
- When users click "check out", the cart goes empty again.

What you can see on admin page:

- Users can add more products.
- Validation on the inputs.
- Users can edit and delete products.
- When the data is changed, the list of products will be rendered to the latest update.
- Users can sort the products by price (ascending and descending)

Users can navigate between those pages.
