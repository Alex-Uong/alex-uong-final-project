#### Description:

I didn't know that we have to submit the final project before 2025 until recently (a bit too late) and I work full-time to provide my family so I really don't have time to finished a projecct. That's why I have to use a demo project that I did with my friend about 2 weeks ago to submit. It was also my effort on computer science so I hope it will work.

This project is a phone selling website that display phones and users can choose which phones to buy. And on the admin side, users can add and manage products.

We didn't finish the whole website due to the lack of time so I just finished some demo as follow.

The homepage has 2 a tag to link to 2 pages: customer page where users can interact and buy products and admin page wherre users can manage products.

We use some basic tailwind and flowbite to style the website and javaScript to do Validation, event handling, add products, edit, delete, add to cart, check out, and so on.

What you can see on customer page:

- I use api to render the product list to show to customers.
- Users can filter brands of phones (Apple and Samsung in this case)
- Users can add phones to cart by click on "add to cart". They can add more by clicking more times.
- Users can click on cart button to open the basket (cart) so see what's inside. And there will be a total amount of money of those products.
- They can increase or decrease the quantity of the product by clicking on plus or minus button.
- When the quantity is 1, and user click on minus button again, there will be a prompt to check if the user wants to deleted the product out of the cart.
- When users click "check out", the cart goes empty again.

What you can see on admin page:

- Users can add more products to the database
- Validation on the inputs.
- Users can edit and delete products.
- When the data is changed, the list of products will be rendered to the latest update.
- Users can sort the products by price (ascending and descending)

Users can navigate between those pages.

It was just a demo so if I had more time, I would turned it into a real website with many more functions and features.

When it comes to practical projects, there are a lot of things happen that I didn't expect. It was very depressing sometimes when something just doesn't work. But I always learned new interesting things from those situation.

I knew that I am pretty late on this new path but I have really enjoyed it so far, especially CS50. I believe that this course will set the new beginning of my life. And I am really eager for that. Thank you!
