#### Description:

I didn't know that we have to submit the final project before 2025 so I have to use a project that I did with my friend to submit. It was also my effort on computer science so I hope it will work.

This project is a phone selling website that display phones and users can choose which phones to buy.

We didn't finish the whole website due to the lack of time (it's the end of 2024 and I work full-time) so I just finished some demo as follow.

The homepage has 2 a tag to link to 2 pages: customer page where users can interact and buy products and admin page wherre users can manage products.

We use some basic tailwind and flowbite to style the website and javaScript to do Validation, event handling, add products, edit, delete, add to cart, check out, and so on.

What you can see on customer page:

- I use api to render the product list.
- Users can filter brands of phones (Apple and Samsung)
- Users can add phones to cart by click on "add to cart". They can add more by clicking more times.
- Users can click on cart button to open the basket (cart) so see what's inside.
- They can increase or decrease the quantity of the product by clicking on plus or minus button.
- When the quantity is 1, and user click on minus button again, there will be a prompt to check if the user wants to deleted the product out of the cart.
- When users click "check out", the cart goes empty again.

What you can see on admin page:

- Users can add more products.
- Validation on the inputs.
- Users can edit and delete products.
- When the data is changed, the list of products will be rendered to the latest update.
- Users can sort the products by price (ascending and descending)

Users can navigate between those pages.
